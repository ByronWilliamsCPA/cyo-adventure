# Known Vulnerabilities

This document tracks CVEs and security advisories that have been identified but cannot
be immediately remediated. Entries must be reviewed within 60 days of the Discovered
date. Any entry older than 60 days without reassessment blocks releases per the OpenSSF
release gate policy.

## PYSEC-2022-42969 | py | Medium

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CVE ID** | PYSEC-2022-42969 |
| **Package** | py |
| **Affected Version** | 1.11.0 |
| **Fixed Version** | No fix available |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **CVSS Score** | 7.5 |
| **Discovered** | 2026-05-21 |

| **Blocking Release** | No |

### Description

ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in the `py` package's
`path.LocalPath` function via crafted input to the `svnwc.status` method.

### Impact on This Project

The `py` package is a transitive dependency of `interrogate` (a docstring coverage
tool) used only in the development environment. It is never present in production
runtime dependencies. The vulnerable `svnwc.status` code path is exercised only
when parsing Subversion repository info, which this project does not do.

### Remediation Plan

- [ ] Monitor upstream `py` package for a fix release (package is largely unmaintained)
- [ ] Evaluate replacing `interrogate` with an alternative docstring coverage tool
  if no fix arrives by 2026-07-20 (reassessment due)

### Why Not Fixed Yet

The `py` package has no released fix version. The package is largely unmaintained.
`interrogate` has not released a version that drops the `py` dependency.

## PYSEC-2026-89 | markdown | High

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CVE ID** | PYSEC-2026-89 |
| **Package** | markdown |
| **Affected Version** | 3.10.2 |
| **Fixed Version** | Fixed only in 3.8.1-3.8.2; no fixed release available for >=3.9 as of 2026-05-21 |
| **Severity** | High |
| **CVSS Score** | 7.5 |
| **Discovered** | 2026-05-21 |
| **Reassessment Due** | 2026-07-20 |
| **Blocking Release** | No |

### Description

DoS via malformed HTML-like sequences that cause `html.parser.HTMLParser` to raise
an unhandled `AssertionError` during Markdown parsing. Python-Markdown does not
catch this exception, so any application parsing attacker-controlled Markdown may
crash. Enables remote unauthenticated Denial of Service in web applications,
documentation systems, CI/CD pipelines, and any service rendering untrusted Markdown.
Also known as CVE-2025-69534 and GHSA-5wmx-573v-2qwq.

### Impact on This Project

The `markdown` package is a transitive dependency of `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`,
and related documentation tools. It is present only in the development environment
(docs tooling). This project does not parse attacker-controlled Markdown input at
runtime. The vulnerability is not exploitable in production. Dev-only impact.

### Remediation Plan

- [ ] Monitor the `markdown` package for a release that fixes PYSEC-2026-89 in
  the 3.9+ series
- [ ] Evaluate pinning `markdown` to `3.8.2` if compatible with `mkdocs` and
  `mkdocs-material` dependencies
- [ ] Reassess by 2026-07-20 whether a fixed version is available or whether
  mkdocs has migrated to a safe markdown version

### Why Not Fixed Yet

The fix landed in `markdown` 3.8.1, but the package subsequently released 3.9 and
3.10.x without incorporating the fix (or re-introduced the vulnerable code path).
As of 2026-05-21, no version in the 3.9+ series resolves this CVE. Downgrading to
3.8.2 may conflict with `mkdocs-material` and other tooling that requires 3.9+.
